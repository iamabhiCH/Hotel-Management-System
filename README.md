# Hotel-Management-System
Minor Project on Hotel Management System.  Developed in Java and MySQL Database or JDBC API used for backend.


Introduction
 
In today’s era computers have become a vital component of any enterprise for giving it proper directions and extensive control of the various activities to attain business objectives. Computer applications have affected scientific & commercial knowledge.

The information system of the old times totally differs from the todays. It is automation system of a hotel management or any information system. In the previous ages the process of maintaining data and record seemed very difficult. Now days, computer is very essential component. The implementation of computer based Information system can be depicted as the ease in handling and maintaining the data bank of any size.

Our project is on Hotel Management System which deals with almost all the functionalities of a Hotel. It keeps the database of customer records and other hotel relater records like, rooms, driver, etc. It also keeps the employees list, room charges and other services list.

The business of Hotels is spread all over the world. A large record should be maintained in a proper manner for running of hotels. The proposed system is a window based menu driven system. It reduces the paper works, time needed for doing various tasks etc. Our project upholds the accuracy of data.
 
Project Objective:-
The main objective of this work is to reduce the difficulties that are found in the present system. The present system requires a lot of paper works, manual works etc. The accuracy is less in the present system. The details must have to be stored manually in the present system.

In the present system, the details of all particular hotel admins are stored hotel related data in different registers by different persons this to data isolation and inconsistency.

There is always an objective behind every innovation and behind every work. We did have many objectives for our project which are described as follows

•	To search records of  rooms, customers, employees etc. efficiently.
•	Processing a large amount of data effectively and efficiently.
•	To provide better service.
•	It keeps database of employees details, rooms price and Customers record.
•	In such a huge project where the amount of data to handle was tremendous, there was strong demand for greater accuracy and consistency.
•	Since the system is subjected to be accessed by number users, the system must safe guard sensitive and important data in a form that is accessible only to the authorized person.
•	Input validation features to make sure that only correct information has been provided.
•	It is easiest way to maintain data of all records.
•	It can generate knowledge about hotel system.



It helps to keep the entire information of the hotel in a systematic way so that it becomes easier to know about the employees, customers and other services of hotel.

Limitations of Projects
•	This is a desktop application only run in computer or laptop.
•	This application is not for booking hotel online.
•	Only Hotel’s Admin can work on this application because this is designed or developed for admin use only.
•	No central database can be created as information is not present in database. 
Future Application of the Project


The different areas where we can use this application are:
	Any hotel administration can make use of it for providing information about rooms, customers, employees, managers and drivers.
	Modification can be easily done according to requirements as and when necessary.
	For the admin dashboard, you will be able to all the basic access in the whole system. Such as employees details, rooms details, customers details, drivers details and other details.
	The admin has access to the hotel management information system. It add, update, and delete the employees, customers, rooms, drivers and other information.
	By default one of the security features of this system is the secure login and logout system.

This software can be easily Implemented under various situations. Any hotel can make use of it for their administration work like add new customer, new room, new employee, new driver etc.
It can be used in any type of HOTEL for managing all the employee,
Customers and other information which is related to the particular hotel.
